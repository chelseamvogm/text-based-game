# text-based-game
I want to make a game where you take your time, take a walk, meet monsters, and make friends. But I don't know programming. I want to study slowly and make it.
I'm new to Godot and programming. Recently, I was able to place a button and display the text "Hello World". I have a game plan, but I haven't studied enough. I want to study Godot little by little and complete it.
Monsters appear in the games I want to make. But don't fight. They are very kind monsters. I am very afraid of humans. The hero uses all means to make friends with monsters.
